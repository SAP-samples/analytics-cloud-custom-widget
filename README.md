## Description
This repository is created to host Custom Widget Samples, ready to use within your Analytical Application or also with the new Optimized and Unified Story Experience.
We offer this GitHub repository to Customers and Partners to share their content by uploading and downloading Custom widget samples.
This repository is mainly for testing purpose and NOT for PRODUCTIVE usage.

## Requirements
All the exisiting Custom Widget Samples are developed with the new property: Data Binding and works ONLY if your optimized view mode (OVM) is enabled within Analytics Designer or with the Optimized and Unified Story Experience.

## Known Issues
If you are planning to host the custom widget within different GitHub repository or different web server, don't forget to change the path to the web componenet files in the JSON file.
